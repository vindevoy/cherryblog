Life is starting again now that the Corona virus is losing its grip in Belgium and for me (vindevoy) this also means school is starting again. I am a student zythology, besides my daytime job and my other activities like programming for CherryBlog and other open source projects.

Therefore, due to double lessons and upcoming exams, there will be no time for, hence no releases for CherryBlog until somewhere in July, 2020.
